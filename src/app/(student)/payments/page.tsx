// app/(student)/payments/page.tsx
/**
 * Payment History page — server component.
 *
 * Fetches all payment records for the current student, including
 * linked booking details and Razorpay transaction IDs.
 *
 * PaymentsClient handles:
 *  - Payment cards with status badges (paid / pending / failed)
 *  - Booking details (library, seat, time)
 *  - Copy Razorpay payment ID and order ID to clipboard
 *  - Total amount paid summary
 *
 * NOTE: PaymentRecord type is defined in lib/actions/student.ts
 *       (not in this file) so PaymentsClient can import it without
 *       crossing the app/ → components/ boundary.
 *
 * Route: /payments
