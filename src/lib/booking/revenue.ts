/**
 * Single source of truth for revenue calculations.
 *
 * Used by:
 *  - owner.getDashboardStats / getMonthlyRevenue  (per-library, time-windowed)
 *  - owner.getMyLibraries (OwnerLibrary.month_revenue, current calendar month)
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: the `payments` table, status = 'paid', joined to
 * `bookings` for library/date filtering. This is unchanged by the
 * slot-only migration — payments rows are inserted identically regardless
 * of whether the booking's price was resolved via base_price (old) or
 * slot_configs (new); the migration changes HOW the amount is computed at
 * booking-creation time, not how it's summed afterward.
 *
 * COVERAGE (all four paths insert into `payments` with status='paid'):
 *  - Online student bookings    → student.ts confirmBookingPayment (Razorpay webhook/confirm)
 *  - Owner manual/walk-in        → owner.manualBookSeat (amountPaid > 0)
 *  - Staff manual/walk-in         → staff-seat-actions.seniorManualBook / staffWalkIn
 *  - Subscription payments        → payments.subscription_id is set, booking_id is null
 *
 * SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE: payments rows with subscription_id set (and
 * booking_id null) represent membership-plan purchases — this is real
 * revenue but is NOT tied to a specific booking/library the way session
 * revenue is (a plan can cover multiple libraries via plan_libraries).
 * getLibraryRevenue (booking-based) intentionally EXCLUDES these — see
 * getSubscriptionRevenueForLibrary for the separate calculation that
 * attributes subscription revenue to a library via plan_libraries.
 *
 * "Free" sessions consumed via an active subscription (no per-booking
 * payment) correctly contribute ₹0 to getLibraryRevenue — the subscription
 * payment was already counted once, at purchase time, via
 * getSubscriptionRevenueForLibrary. Summing both would double-count.
